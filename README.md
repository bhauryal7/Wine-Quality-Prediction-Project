## Overview

This project focuses on MLOps for predicting wine quality from the popular wine dataset from University of Irvine. The project follows a modular coding approach, ensuring code reusability and maintainability. A complete ML pipeline is built and deployed using a Flask web application.

## Features

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables if applicable)

Feature engineering and selection

Elastic Net Regression model training and evaluation

Model deployment using Flask

## Workflows

1. Data Ingestion
2. Data Validation
3. Data Transformation-- Feature Engineering,Data Preprocessing
4. Model Trainer
5. Model Evaluation- MLFLOW, Dagshub
6. Prediction 

## Future Improvements

Experiment with other machine learning and deep learning models.
